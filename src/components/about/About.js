                <p>
                    I'm a junior developer and an Applied Mathematics student
                    with a passion for backend development and APIs. I love exploring
                    how technology works behind the scenes and enjoy building robust
                    server-side applications. My background in math has trained me to
                    think analytically and solve problems logically. I bring that mindset
                    into my coding journey. I'm always curious and eager to learn something
                    new every day.
