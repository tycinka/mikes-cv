My background in math helps me approach coding with a logical mindset, and I'm always trying to improve and pick up new skills.

## Technologies & Tools

🌱 **Ruby on Rails** – Currently learning how to build web apps and APIs.  
🐘 **PHP (Nette Framework)** – Some experience creating simple web projects.
