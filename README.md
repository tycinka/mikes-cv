Hello, world! 👋
About Me

I'm a junior developer and an Applied Mathematics student with a passion for backend development and APIs. I love exploring how technology works behind the scenes and enjoy building robust server-side applications. My background in math has trained me to think analytically and solve problems logically. I bring that mindset into my coding journey. I'm always curious and eager to learn something new every day.
Technologies & Tools

    🌱 Ruby on Rails: Currently learning to build web applications and APIs with Rails.

    🐘 PHP (Nette Framework): Experience building web projects using the Nette framework.

    🐍 Python: Familiar with using Python for scripting and data analysis tasks.

Learning & Goals

Right now, I'm diving deeper into Ruby on Rails to expand my backend development skills. In the near future, I plan to start sharing some of the projects I've been working on (stay tuned!). My goal is to keep growing as a developer, and I hope to eventually contribute to open-source projects and collaborate on exciting backend initiatives.

Thanks for visiting my profile! 😊
